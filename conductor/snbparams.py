  This module provides functions for reading/writing the VIC "Snow Band File",

  The format of the snow band file is one line per VIC cell:
  cell_id_0 area_frac_band_0 ... area_frac_band_N median_elev_band_0 ...
  median_elev_band_N (and optionally, Pfactor_band_0 ... Pfactor_band_N,
  although VIC no longer uses these so we don't support them here) where
  N should be equal to num_snow_bands
